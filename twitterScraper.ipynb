During the 2015 floods, I was stranded in my apartment for nearly a week, without electricity, and with limited food supplies, along with my family. As soon as the water level receded, we immediately relocated to Bangalore. Words cannot express the anguish and despair we experienced during that time. It is heartbreaking to see Chennai grappling with the same calamity once again, I empathize deeply with the people of Chennai who are now facing this crisis once again. 🙏😑  #ChennaiFloods #ChennaiRains #chennaicyclone #ChennaiRains2023',\n",

Hope you all are safe & sound with your families & water especially drainage water not entering your houses & most importantly hope you have unconditional supply of food & electricity. Just checking as a Voter coz as Citizens living in the same city as you are, we are not in the same position. I wonder if the entire storm water drain project was meant for Singapore or Chennai?   Can u pls let us know as we in 2015 came on to the roads to help people in distress but after 8 years it is pathetic to see an even worse condition.   We will continue to help this time around also for sure with food supplies & water, but I guess this time would love to see all the representatives of each constituency come out & do the needful & instil hope & help rather than fear & distress.  I put my head down in shame as I write to you. Awaiting not a miracle but wat is called DUTY to Citizens. God Bless.  @chennaicorp @PriyarajanDMK @RAKRI1 #CycloneMichuang #ChennaiRains2023',\n",

This was the reason Cooum River was flowing in brim with extreme rains in upper catchment.  Tambaram 409 mm (173 and 236 mm) in Adyar river upper catchment. Adyar river is also in full brim.  Coming to 3rd Kosasthalayar river which is also flowing in brim. At one point 45000 cusecs was released from Poondi.

The naval personnel not only conducted rescues but also provided essential supplies to those evacuated.

These remarks do not contribute to the unity and integrity of our diverse nation. Senthil Kumar’s attack on North Indians with ‘gaumutra’ jibes inside the Parliament shows the mindset of DMK. From Sanatana Dharma to Gaumutra, all they can do is bring a divide. Want to ask CONgress if they have the courage to counter this as they ruled one of the States? Do they agree to what DMK says? Is this not a direct racist attack on the people living in the heart land of India? Will they protest outside DMK HQs, burn effigies, shout slogans, revolt for such a blatant racist comment?  This tukde tukde gang of convenience will scratch each other’s back for political, power and monetary gain. All they lack is a heart and courage to serve the people. Shame on DMK & CONgress.  Senthil Kumar should issue an apology immediately.  #DMKinsultsVoters',\n",

       "   'text': 'So far the 2015 flood was the worst in chennai.  But that was a (wo)man made crisis..due sheer negligence of understanding the level of rain. (47cm in just one day)  Instead of the gradual opening of water,they holded it in #sembarambakkam for a week & opened it over night.  Hence such a disaster recorded  in the history of Tamil Nadu by killing 100s & making losses of nearly 20000s of crores.  2023 Rain exceeded the previous record of 47 cm in one single day.. It is recorded close to 200 cm on one single day.The worst news is that this is not the end. It will be continued to today & tomorrow also.  Just imagine what would be the damages & situation right now..  But this time there are no man made crisis..  A few deadly incidents happened accidentally near the water reservoir areas like lakes.(Breakage of compound walls)  Throughout the city except the places where the rainwater drain system not functioning or choked by plastic stuff flood didnt disturbed the people much.  The low areas are filled with rain water up to 4-5 ft level which is unavoidable due to continuous pouring of heavy rain which rules out the draining system in place.  This situation is very hard & tough for those people undergoing it. But with in a day or two this areas will be  cleared. Already help reached many of them.   Some people left their houses on their own and staying at friends & relative places.  Govt also taking them to safe places.  Chennai corporation officers & workers are on the field attending issues area by area.  Also the ministers MLAs councillor everybody on the field.  The govt machinery working on full swing to support & help people.  Social activists & Volunteer too contributing to this.. They are arranging food packets& essencials to the needy people.  Matter of a day or two..  We will bounce back..  To normalcy..  We the Chennaiates..!  -Kathir RS',\n",

       "   'text': \"English version #MPsDos   I don't know if you understand, let's ask the members and see.  Out of 543 people, how many people have done their duty correctly?  If anyone had worked with them for 5 years, India would have been an example to many foreign countries, what problems Modi would have solved in his constituency, what Amit Shah would have done for his constituencies!  Just 5 years of work for the people is enough.  Below you can see what a Member of Parliament job is for everyone.  A Member of Parliament (MP) in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, plays a crucial role in the Indian democratic system. They are elected directly by the people of their constituency to represent their interests and concerns in the national legislature.  **Key Roles and Responsibilities**  1. **Legislative Role:**     * **Initiating and Enacting Laws:** MPs actively participate in the legislative process, introducing and debating bills that become laws governing various aspects of national life.  2. **Representational Role:**     * **Constituency Representation:** MPs serve as the voice of their constituents, bringing their concerns, issues, and aspirations to the attention of the Parliament and the government.  3. **Oversight Role:**     * **Holding the Government Accountable:** MPs scrutinize the government's policies, programs, and expenditures, ensuring that the executive branch is fulfilling its responsibilities effectively.  4. **Electoral Role:**     * **Electing the President and Vice-President:** Lok Sabha MPs participate in the electoral process for selecting the President and Vice-President of India.  5. **Committee Participation:**     * **Serving on Parliamentary Committees:** MPs contribute to the work of various parliamentary committees, which examine specific policy areas and draft reports with recommendations.  6. **Raising Public Issues:**     * **Debating Issues in Parliament:** MPs raise public issues, concerns, and grievances through questions, debates, and motions in the Lok Sabha.  7. **Local Development Advocacy:**     * **Promoting Constituency Development:** MPs advocate for the development of their constituencies, seeking funds and projects for infrastructure, education, and healthcare.  8. **Party Representation:**     * **Representing Party's Policies:** MPs uphold the policies and ideologies of their respective political parties, articulating their positions in the Parliament.  9. **Constituency Service:**     * **Addressing Constituents' Needs:** MPs address the individual needs and problems of their constituents, connecting them with government agencies and seeking solutions.  10. **Public Outreach:**     * **Maintaining Public Engagement:** MPs interact with their constituents, attending public meetings, receiving feedback, and addressing their concerns.  In addition to these core roles, MPs also play a crucial role in shaping national policies, debating public issues, and upholding democratic values. They serve as a bridge between the people and the government, ensuring that the voices of the citizens are heard and their concerns are addressed.  #chennai #சென்னை_மழை #ChennaiRain #ChennaiFlood #ChennaiRains #ChennaiRains2023 #ChennaiFloods2023 #ChennaiWeather #CycloneMichuang #CycloneMichaung #Cyclone #Michaungcyclone #MichaungStorm #DMKGovt #TamilNadu #Tamil #India #LokSabha #LoksabhaElection2024 #LoksabhaElection #ParliamentWinterSession #ParliamentSession #ElectionResults #electionresults2023\",\n",

Too much rain in a short period of time, and opening the flood gates of nearby lake (at least one that we know of) have inundated large chunks of urban areas, and...  Water has entered into homes!  (The last time this happened in 2015, two feet of water entered in my parents' home, and they had to spend days cleaning up the filthy mess and restoring... well, everything - home interior and things.)  Parked two-wheelers have been submerged in three feet of water, rendering them inoperable.  And, no power, and no internet for those who rely on power!  How do I know all this? Well, trust me, I know!  #ChennaiRains2023 !\",\n",
